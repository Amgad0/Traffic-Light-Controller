# Traffic-Light-Controller
Traffic Light Controller on TivaC Launchpad
The aim of this project is to implement a traffic light control system that contain two traffics, one of them allow cars to move from north to south, and the other is used to allow cars to move from east to west. Beside each traffic there is a pedestrian traffic light, the pedestrian must press on button to have his light green to cross street safely. Using Code Composer Studio, TivaWare Peripheral Driver Library and TivaC we designed a traffic light control system.
